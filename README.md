BookER
Booker is a website that uses user-inputted data to recommend books. Using Scikit learn, books that the user may like, based on their preferences, will be recommended to them.
The user can make an account. They can create a list of books with ratings that will allow the AI to make accurate recommendations. A recommendations page can be viewed. This page will have books sorted by the possibility of the user to like the book. The user also has an option to filter the search results by genres.
