Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.",English,9780451529305,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Childrens', 'Classic Literature', 'Novels']","['Marmee', 'Meg March', 'Beth March', 'Amy March', 'Laurie Laurence', 'Mr. Laurence', 'Professor Bhaer', 'Mr. March', 'Hannah Brown', 'Aunt March', 'John Brooke', 'Jo March']",Paperback,,449,Signet Classics,04/06/04,09/30/68,[],1681583,"['721282', '541255', '299023', '82023', '38000']",93.0,"['Concord, Massachusetts (United States)', 'Massachusetts (United States)', 'London, England', 'New England (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475l/1934._SY475_.jpg,354812,4063,5.51

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.
