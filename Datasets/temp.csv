On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.",English,9780062024039,"['Young Adult', 'Dystopia', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Romance', 'Adventure', 'Teen', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Action']","['Albert', 'Drew Leighton (Divergent)', 'Eric (Divergent)', 'Beatrice Prior', 'Peter', 'Caleb Prior', 'Natalie Prior', 'Molly Atwood', 'Christina', 'Jeanine Matthews', 'Marcus Eaton', 'Tobias Eaton']",Paperback,,487,Katherine Tegen Books,02/28/12,04/25/11,"['Georgia Peach Book Award (2012)', 'South Carolina Book Award for Young Adult (2014)', 'Rhode Island Teen Book Award (2013)', 'Evergreen Teen Book Award (2014)', 'Soaring Eagle Book Award (2012)', 'Milwaukee County Teen Book Award Nominee (2012)', ""Children's Choice Book Award Nominee for Teen Choice Book of the Year (2012)"", 'Sakura Medal', 'New Mexico Land of Enchantment Award for Young Adult (2014)', 'Eliot Rosewater Indiana High School Book Award (2014)', 'California Young Readers Medal for Young Adult (2014)', 'Lincoln Award Nominee (2014)', 'DABWAHA Romance Tournament for Best Young Adult Romance (2012)', 'Goodreads Choice Award for Favorite Book and for Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction and Nominee for Goodreads Author (2011)', 'Green Mountain Book Award (2013)', 'The Magnolia Award for 6-8 (2014)', ""Louisiana Teen Readers' Choice (2014)"", 'Missouri Gateway Readers Award (2014)', 'Oklahoma Sequoyah Award for High Schol (2014)', 'Premio El Templo de las Mil Puertas Nominee for Mejor novela extranjera perteneciente a saga (2011)']",2906258,"['1409189', '882493', '434381', '123286', '56909']",94.0,"['Chicago, Illinois (United States)']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1588455221l/13335037._SY475_.jpg,793269,8339,0.88
40961427-1984,1984,,George Orwell,4.19,"Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.",English,B003JTHWKU,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Politics', 'School', 'Fantasy', 'Adult']","['Winston Smith', 'Big Brother', ""O'Brien"", 'Emmanuel Goldstein', 'Tom Parsons', 'Syme', 'Julia']",Kindle Edition,,237,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,09/03/13,06/08/49,"['Prometheus Hall of Fame Award (1984)', 'Locus Award Nominee for All-Time Best Science Fiction Novel (1987)']",3140442,"['1474277', '1025880', '453693', '121946', '64646']",94.0,"['London, England', 'England', 'United Kingdom']",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1532714506l/40961427._SX318_.jpg,324371,3544,
5907.The_Hobbit_or_There_and_Back_Again,"The Hobbit, or There and Back Again",The Hobbit,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.27,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).",English,9780618260300,"['Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Young Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Epic Fantasy', 'Novels']","['Gandalf', 'Bilbo Baggins', 'Thorin Oakenshield', 'Smaug', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Gollum', 'Dwalin', 'Balin', 'Kili', 'Fili', 'Dori', 'Ori', 'Nori', 'Oin', 'Gloin', 'Bifur', 'Bofur', 'Bombur', 'Beorn', 'Bard the Bowman']",Paperback,,366,Houghton Mifflin,08/15/02,09/21/37,"['Keith Barker Millennium Book Award', 'Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards for Older Readers (1997)', 'Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inklings Studies (1990)']",2896265,"['1527113', '853247', '359399', '95662', '60844']",95.0,['Middle-earth'],https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546071216l/5907.jpg,107478,1284,4.68
